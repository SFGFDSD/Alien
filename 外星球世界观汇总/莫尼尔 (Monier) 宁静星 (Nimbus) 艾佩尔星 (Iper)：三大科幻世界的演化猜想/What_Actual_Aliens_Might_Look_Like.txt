What Actual Aliens Might Look Like
==================================

what do real aliens look like we know that life on Earth is incredibly diverse and exists in the strangest and most extreme places from Blue Dragon sea slugs to I eyes or CRI of Malon snails with shells of iron or whatever this is supposed to be let's use our imagination and real science to travel to three possible worlds each more alien than the next put on your future science suit and enter the ptal to witness wonders never seen before the eye of oculus this is the red dwarf star Oculus five times smaller than our sun and a lot less bright a bit larger than Earth but orbiting its star 20 times closer you see the ice hell of the planet iper it's Tiddly locked so one side experiences a never- Ending night and the other an eternal day lit by the Stars dim glow in the region facing the dim Stars directly temperatures are warm and pleasant the hell of ice has melted into a shallow Black Ocean the eye of iper about the size of Europe barely 200 M at its deepest points churned by a NeverEnding storm where hot air meets The Frigid winds from the icy outskirts but below this inhospitable chaos we find calm stability an ecosystem in almost perfect balance let's dive in instead of meeting Open Water we Splash into a floating underwater jungle we know places like this are hoe kelp forests made from seaweeds up to 65 M long Sheltering countless smaller creatures on Earth we get abundant white sunlight so our plants evolve to be green absorbing the most useful red wavelengths for photosynthesis and reflecting away the rest but Oculus shines not nearly as bright and its dim rays are even further DED by the storm so here plants are a deep black to make use of the weak infar leftovers which also gives the eye of iper its striking black color over billions of years the jungle has occupied all possible space in the eye its roots extend deep into the seabed mud anchoring them and providing access to nutrients they drop their seat in the few free spaces in the mud only death makes room for New Life big and streamlined teardrop-shaped creatures push through the Dark Water they kind of look like fish just like many sea creatures on Earth their shape is optimized for the lowest drag when traveling through water like underwater cattle they lazily swim through the forest grazing on leaves in peace suddenly a patch of Strang looking leaves begins to move and wraps around a distracted Grazer dragging it down into hungry Jaws a predator that's had eons to adapt its camouflage to fool its prey but not only by imitating leaves both Hunter and prey never Evol involved eyes in this dark underwater MC instead they do battle with sounds and textures listen there's a whole cacophony down here countless species are singing to each other sending warnings or invitations forming a collective song like the noisy jungles of Earth except how monkeys and screaming peers are replaced by chattering seed eaters poking at the mud with snapping pinces squeaking Spike bulbs loaded with poison and the flailing fins of starfish-shaped Grabbers hunting small prey beautiful and unsettling in this stable and never changing ecosystem their music will never end for billions of years you seem to have been noticed and blind creepers are crawling towards you you want to explore this world not become part of it so it's time to leave the clouds of nimbus you're immersed in the blinding light of the B type star culus shining Hot and Blue orbited by a dozen lava planets burned to a crisp but we'll visit the last planet Nimbus a gas giant very much like Neptune in size and composition except there's a lot more water and seething hot kyus showers it with 900 times more light than Neptune so its atmosphere is warm enough for gigantic white clouds the size of countries to be lofted upwards by Titan tanic warm updrafts rising from the hazy depths millions of years ago and astonishingly quickly life emerged and evolved inside tiny water droplets deeper down in the planet like extremophile microbes on Earth they found ways of breathing methane and using exotic enzymes to harvest sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the air as kyus grew hotter and brighter the higher altitudes of nimbus became habitable and lifes spread let's dive into to the gigantic white clouds to meet it up here live quadrillions of tiny beings a kind of cloud Plankton so small they're carried on the gentlest air currents the most common type resembles flat four-legged spiders barely a millimet white tinted yellow by The sulfur they consume they gain lift with wispy electrostatic threads thinner than spider silk pulling on the charge differences between the top and bottom of the cloud oceans a technique zyus crab spiders used use to travel great distances on Earth you're just in time for Mating Season billions of cloud Plankton gather to join their threads into huge parachutes that ride updrafts for hundreds of kilometers here in the hot Heights they hatch their eggs before their life comes to an end other tiny creatures latch on most of them Predators looking to Feast on fresh young Lings but not all life on Nimbus is Tiny the other way to stay up in the sky forever is to become a living balloon like the enormous Sky whales taller than a skyscraper almost completely made of a wafer thin membrane they heat up trapped gases making them less dense than the air around them giving them buoyancy the bigger their gas envelope the more lift it produces so Sky whales evolve to be as large as possible only a lumpy car-sized spherical bag of organs hangs at its bottom heating up all this gas requires a lot of energy so it's time to feed the spherical body opens up unfolding and lowering a huge sticky net into the white clouds on Earth the largest animals to ever exist blue whales feed by filtering millions of tiny Krill each day similarly the sky Wales of nimbus filter Sky Plankton out of the clouds most is consumed right away and burned in specialized glands to generate heat the rest is converted into an orange and energy dense nectar for later this nectar is the most valuable resource on Nimbus numerous predators are looking for it but none so hungrily as the Frog sized jet squids evolutionary cousins of the whales several of them Trail each Sky whale waiting for it to be distracted or sleepy after a succulent meal jet squids are far less efficient floaters but they're able to superheat and expel gases in short bursts like a rocket like vampiric hummingbirds their long and pointy beaks try to pierce their prey and lap up some of the nectar inide unlike in the stable Eye iper Life on Nimbus is doomed B type stars like kulus live for a few hundred million years at most and this time is coming to its end soon it will be burning through its fuel at an astounding rate and violently burn our gas giant life on Nimbus is only 600 million years old and has barely 10 million years left is this tragic or is this unique ecosystem lucky to have existed in the first place something to ponder As you move on before your jetpack runs out of fuel a Fatal Attraction orad is a yass brown dwarf 13 times more massive than Jupiter and with a magnetic field 60 times stronger it belongs to the yellow star sturgeon which is about to disappear behind aed's Shadow but you're interested in Monier one of orad's many moons it should get as much sunlight as our Earth but its 3-hour orbit around the brown dwarf means its days are extremely short gravity here is a mere 5% of Earth so the moon can only hold on to a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere that doesn't retain much heat so its average temperature is far below freezing as its cold night begins a chill descends on Monier and dry ice snow falls from the sky a green blue and red Aurora illuminates the landscape made from Star plasma caught in aed's magnetic field and striking moner's atmosphere the sturgeon system was born from a nebula saturated with Metals so iron and Lead are abundant in this frigid cold chalk full of toxic minerals life found unique ways to make the best of a bad situation by using ammonia instead of water which would freeze in the short nights and by incorporating magnetized minerals and ard's magnetic field into its biology on Earth species like obers or bees have learned to sense magnetic fields but life on Monier takes it to a whole other level as sturgeon Rises and its red Rays filter through orad's cresant a yellow glow rushes over the horizon the snowfall stops and temperatures quickly rise the ground creeks and multicolored liquids trickle out from fishes all around you cryo volcanism just like on Jupiter's moon Europa brittle seaming bundles start to unspoil and climb off the ground towards the bright star like Arctic flowers on Earth sprouting in the short summer these plants don't have a minute of daytime to waste their blossoms are saturated with Magnetic minerals making use of the extreme magnetism and low gravity to levitate reaching up to a kilometer into the sky extending the sunset for as long as possible hey don't touch them with a loud crack the sky flower detaches itself from the ground and drifts Out Of Reach suddenly your surrounded hundreds of shiny Critters Zoom by they look like ice skating snails and can Circle Monier faster than the sunset from their head they extend two long stalks that are electrically conductive and merge up top a magnetic kite that drags them along the surface at breathtaking speeds the skaters formed a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic purple microorganisms that live in their shells these biological solar panels produce sugars that they share with the skaters in exchange for continuous Starlight if the skaters ever stop they risk their Partners freezing and death by starvation the harmonic scenery is violently interrupted as the ground splinters open and a spiked metal claw grabs a skater and crushes it it belongs to an animal that looks like a cross between a sea lion and a beetle as it devours its prey it gets covered in pink and sparkly fluids these ambushes hide in the crystalline ground spreading an array of electrically sensitive whiskers that they use to detect their prey and strike just as they Zoom by like living landmines that could be buried everywhere maybe you should end your stroll the darkness will return soon it's time to return home back home earth warm and pleasant it's good to be home in the environment you and all other life that's not made up evolved in but who knows if you look up with a
